不管是信息总结，还是信息提取，你一定会输入大段文字，甚至多段文字，此时有个小技巧。

可以用 “”“ 将指令和文本分开。根据我的测试，如果你的文本有多段，增加 ”“” 会提升 AI 反馈的准确性（这个技巧来自于 OpenAI 的 API [最佳实践文档](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api)）

感谢 CraneHuang6 的提醒，这里还能用 ### 符号区隔，不过我一般会用 “”“ ，因为我有的时候会用 # 作为格式示例，太多 # 的话 prompt 会看起来比较晕 😂
:::

像我们之前写的 prompt 就属于 Less effective prompt。为什么呢？据我的测试，主要还是 AI 不知道什么是指令，什么是待处理的内容，用符号分隔开来会更利于 AI 区分。
